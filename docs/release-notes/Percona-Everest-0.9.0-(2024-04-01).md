## Release highlights

### Breaking change in Percona Everest 0.9.0

!!! warning
    Percona Everest introduces a breaking change that prevents you from directly upgrading to version 0.9.0.

To install Percona Everest 0.9.0, make sure to [uninstall](https://docs.percona.com/everest/install/uninstallEverest.html) any previous versions by running the command:

    everestctl uninstall

### Enhanced point-in-time recovery for databases

We've taken a step forward in enhancing Percona Everest's point-in-time (PITR) capabilities for PostgreSQL, MySQL as well as MongoDB databases. 

You can now restore your databases to specific points in time within the same cluster as well as a new cluster. This gives you more control over your database environments and more options for data recovery.

If you're looking for in-depth insights into this feature, refer to the sections [Create new database from a point-in-time recovery](https://docs.percona.com/everest/use/createBackups/create_new_database.html#create-a-new-database-from-pitr) and [Restore to a point-in-time recovery](https://docs.percona.com/everest/use/RestoreBackup.html#restore-to-a-point-in-time-recovery) in our documentation.
