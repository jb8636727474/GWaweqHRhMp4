# Upgrade Percona Everest using the CLI

Percona Everest regularly releases updates that contain bug fixes, security improvements, and other enhancements to improve the overall performance of your database.


## Before you upgrade

!!! note
     It is recommended to install the latest version of the CLI .

You can only upgrade one minor version at a time. For instance, you can upgrade from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0 but you cannot directly upgrade from version 1.0.0 to version 1.2.0.  

## Upgrade

!!! note
    It is recommended that you create backups of your databases prior to upgrading Percona Everest.
