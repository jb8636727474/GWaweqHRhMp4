# Monitoring

Percona Everest provides monitoring capabilities with PMM to maintain a reliable and secure database infrastructure.

Here are some key benefits you'll get with monitoring of Percona Everest:

- Database availability and uptime tracking
- Insights into your database performance
- Proactive issue detection and addressing opportunities
- Continuous monitoring

## The concept of namespaces in monitoring

When you assign namespaces to a monitoring instance, it only determines which databases are authorized to utilize that monitoring instance, you cannot monitor specific namespaces. 

Each database can only be monitored by one instance, which means that the metrics for the database are only available to that instance.

When adding a new monitoring instance, the monitoring stack (kube-state-metrics and victoria-metrics) will automatically start pushing kubernetes metrics to that instance.

## Prerequisites

To use monitoring in Percona Everest, you should have a PMM instance up and running.

For information on installing PMM, see the [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/index.html).
